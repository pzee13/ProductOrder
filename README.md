# ProductOrder
I have created mainly 3 files which are:
*Sample (main )
*Service 
*ServiceImpl

Since the main file sample is flooded with lot of methods, I included a service interface for declaring the differet methods needed. 
And these methods are implemented in the SericeImpl file using implement of Serivice class.
Also I have used a lot of static values like wrap_fee inorder for it to be global and reduced lot of code .
